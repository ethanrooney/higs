This is a geant simulation of the HINDA Detector set up at the High Intensity Gamma Source.

This README was developed while doing a fresh installation of geant4-10.6.2 on a LINUX installation from this link:

https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/releases/tag/v10.6.2


To use this simulation you must have GEANT4 installed according to the following instructions:
http://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/geant4-userdoc/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/gettingstarted.html

Untarred the geant4 source in a directory (Assuming a directory called builds in user home directory).

From the location of the geant4 download run:

tar -xf geant4-10.6.2.tar.gz -C /home/etuxr/builds/geant4-10.6.2/
mkdir /home/etuxr/builds/geant4-10.6.2-build/
cd /home/etuxr/builds/geant4-10.6.2-build/

cmake -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATA=ON -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/etuxr/builds/geant4-10.6.2-install/ .
make
make install

This should yeild a functional version of GEANT4


Then to install the HINDA simulation run

cd /home/etuxr/builds/
git clone git@github.com:ethanrooney/higs
mkdir higs-build
cd higs-build
cmake ../higs
make


NOTE the file higs/Makefile will need to be edited to properly provide the correct directory.
NOTE the location of beamCalc.root is hardcoded in higs/src/PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc

NOTE the file /home/etuxr/builds/geant4-10.6.2-install/bin/geant4.sh needs to be sourced in the .bashrc
NOTE for versions of ROOT before 6.20 you must declair ROOT_DIR 

Example of lines to add to .bashrc

export ROOT_DIR="/usr/bin/root"
source /home/etuxr/builds/geant4-10.6.2-install/bin/geant4.sh 
source /usr/bin/thisroot.sh
